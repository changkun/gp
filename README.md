## Prerequisites

The course is designed for senior bachelor students or master students
who have taken those following courses (or have equivalent knowledge):

- [Computer Graphics 1](https://www.medien.ifi.lmu.de/lehre/ss20/cg1/)

Registration is open at Uni2Work both for [Bachelor students](https://uni2work.ifi.lmu.de/course/W20/IfI/GP) and [Master students](https://uni2work.ifi.lmu.de/course/W20/IfI/PGP).

## Communication

We use our [GP GitHub repository](https://github.com/mimuc/gp-ws2021) to manage all course resources, submissions, project proposals, etc. and use its [issue tracker](https://github.com/mimuc/gp-ws2021/issues) for online questions and discussions.

Please register yourself on GitHub if you do not have a GitHub account yet. You can use any distinguishable identifier for your username if you do not want your real name to appear on GitHub publicly.

## Preparation

Since we use GitHub to organize the course, it is recommended for you to get familiar with GitHub beforehand. The following tools are used in the course, please install them before you taking the course: [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) (2.90+), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v14+).

## Syllabus

In this practical course, students will learn and practice more about geometry processing algorithms in 3D graphics, including mesh representation, discrete differential geometry, smoothing, parameterization, remeshing, deformation, shape analysis, etc.

During the semester, students will participate in the course every two weeks to discuss and learn more geometry processing techniques, then do 5 out of 6 geometry processing coding projects.

Along the semester, students should propose a project idea, and by the end of semester, implement and demonstrate their project in 2-5 minutes in video format.

## Grading

The grading scheme contains two parts: _coding projects_ and _individual project_.

### (50%) Coding Projects

Please check [this document](./homeworks/README.md) for further details for the submissions.

### (50%) Individual Project

Please check [this document](./projects/README.md) for further details for the submissions.

### Late and Cheat Policy

Late: _0.005% subtraction for every minute late._

- For each coding project, you have 2000 minutes (10%/0.005%) to send your pull request at the very latest, otherwise, you will receive 0 points from the corresponding project.

Cheat: You don't.

- Coding projects will surround the re-implementation of well-known GP algorithms, workflows, etc.
- If one sent a pull request, then he/she's the solution will be visible publicly
- We will discuss the solution anyway
- If you found someone plagiarize your submission, ask the person to stop privately; if you can't find consensus together, please talk to me
- If you just want a pass, we do not recommend participation in this course
- **You don't want to cheat because you take responsibility for your own study**
