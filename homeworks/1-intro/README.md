# Homework 1: Rendering a Mesh

1. Re-implement the rasterization and ray tracing pipeline

   - See [SS20 CG1 Assignment 7](https://www.medien.ifi.lmu.de/lehre/ss20/cg1/#tutorial) (ray tracing) and [Online-Hausarbeiten 3](https://www.medien.ifi.lmu.de/lehre/ss20/cg1/#online-hausarbeiten) (rasterization)

2. Getting started with Blender

   - Find awesome YouTube videos that fits your taste, e.g. [Blender Guru](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPrnSACiTJ4&ab_channel=BlenderGuru).
   - Use models from GitHub repository, reproduce the course [teaser figure](../../assets/teaser.png).
   - Checkout Blender's [API documentation](https://docs.blender.org/api/current/index.html), try to reproduce the figure in Python.

3. Extend the rasterizer, implement an .obj file loader that loads the model into your mesh data structure instead using [THREE.OBJLoader](https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/en/loaders/OBJLoader)

   - Think about how would you turn the learned data structure to code.
   - Read blender's [developer documentation](https://wiki.blender.org/wiki/Source/Modeling/BMesh/Design), try to answer these questions:
     - What is the blender's internal mesh data structure?
     - How it works and what are the differences compare to what we learned in the kick-off session?

4. Start think about your individual project
