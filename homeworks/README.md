## Submission Instruction

Homework details and its code skeleton will be presented in different folders,
for example [`1-intro`](./1-intro/README.md).

To submit your solution, you should create a folder named by your GitHub
username in the `solutions` folder and that folder will serve for all of your future submissions.

For example, in the `solutions`, there is an existing folder `changkun`
that demonstrates to you how you should organize your submission:

```
homeworks
├── 1-intro                     <-- Homework folder
│   ├── README.md               <-- Homework details
│   └── src                     <-- Homework code skeletons
│       └── main.js             <-- Skeleton's source file
├── README.md                   <-- This file
└── solutions                   <-- Folder for all submissions
    └── changkun                <-- Your GitHub username
        └── 1-intro             <-- One of your submissions (this case is homework 1)
            ├── assets          <-- Folder for your assets
            │   └── figure.png
            ├── README.md       <-- README that explains your submission 
            └── src             <-- Folder for all of your code
                └── main.js
```
