# Homework 5: Quadric Error Metric Simplification

In this homework, your task is to implement the
[QEM Simplification](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/258734.258849)
algorithm.

## Skeleton

The skeleton for this homework is structured as follows:

```
5-remesh
├── package.json
├── package-lock.json
├── README.md                <-- You work on this file
├── src
│   ├── assets
│   │   ├── bunny_tri.obj
│   │   └── sphere.obj
│   ├── halfedge.js          <-- You work on this file
│   ├── main.js              <-- Change this file if needed
│   ├── mat.js
│   ├── pq.js
│   ├── renderer.js
│   └── vec.js
└── webpack.config.js
```

Implementation hints:

1. Your primary task is to implement the `Halfedge.simplify` method in the `halfedge.js`, but you will have to build halfedge representation of a given mesh first. Reuse your work from previous homeworks
2. Use `PriorityQueue` implementation from `pq.js` and `Matrix` implementation from `mat.js`
3. It might be useful to read the code in `main.js`, and you are allowed to change code there if needed

Think and answer the following questions:

1. What's the most unanticipated issue when you were implementing QEM? Explain your coding experience and encountered challenges briefly.
2. What are the cases missing from algorithm description, and how did you deal with it? For example, in which case you cannot do edge collapse directly. Explain your decision in your implementation.

## Submission

Before you submit, please read [this](../README.md) document and understand
how you should organize your submitted files.

For this project, you should submit the following files (i.e. exclude the `assets` folder):

```
├── package.json
├── package-lock.json
├── README.md
├── src
│   ├── halfedge.js
│   ├── main.js
│   ├── mat.js
│   ├── pq.js
│   ├── renderer.js
│   └── vec.js
└── webpack.config.js
```
