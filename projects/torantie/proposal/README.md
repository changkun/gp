## Abstract

A short abstract that summarizes your proposal. Maximum 200 words.

## Motivation

In this section, you should write a good introduction to the background of your project.
The following questions should be answered as an introduction:

1. What is the problem or feature that you want to include in your project?
2. Why is it interesting to *you*, or what motivates you to work on it?

## Proposal

This section should discuss the core idea of your proposal, and also
addresses these question:

1. What exactly you want to implement? Explain with decent details.
2. Is your proposal related to a research paper(s)? List all of them.
3. Why this is a geometry processing related topic/project?
4. What are the existing implementations/solutions? Or if not, please indicate.
5. How exactly your project can do things differently?

Note that it is acceptable if there is an existing implementation. What's important is, you must do your implementation differently, e.g., an existing implementation was written in C++ and OpenGL, and you propose to implement it using JavaScript and three.js.

## Implementation

This section should discuss a concrete plan about how you plan to implement your proposed idea. The following question should be answered in this section:

1. What could be the development settings, e.g., programming language, possible dependencies, target platforms, etc.
2. What are the milestones for your project?
3. What issues might occur in each milestone during the implementation?
4. What challenges you might encounter?
5. How are you plan to solve all these issues and challenges?
6. If you cannot solve them, what are your alternative solutions (Plan B)?

## References

The reference section should list all possible resources (e.g., Research papers, blog posts, development documentation, YouTube videos, etc.) that can help you finish the implementation. All resources should be formulated in the following format and ordered by name: 

- Author name. Title. Publish date. https://link.to.the/resource.
