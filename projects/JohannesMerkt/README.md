# Procedural Geometry with Code
## Motivation
Drawing with shaders is very powerful, it allows for high performant art that updates in real time, is procedural and can also be interactive. I find that fascinating. ***But what if I could write shaders that describe 3d Geometry?*** Then you could create complex geometry in a completly new way.

## Result
I have created the fundamentals for creating an engine that gets a function describing a volume and turns this into geometry in realtime. 

The function describing the geometry with its density output has the coordinates x, y and z as input together with a time parameter and should return a density value. Every density value above 1 is considered inside the geometry and every density value below 0 is outside the geometry.
Here is what such a function describing a plane could look like:
``` hlsl
float calculateDensity(float x, float y, float z, float time) {
    return 1.2 - y; // density value float
}
```
And this is the expected output:

To turn the outputs of this function into a geometry I use the marching cubes algorithm. This algorithm is typically run on a CPU where it is quite slow. So I attempted to speed it up by using Compute Shaders. The performance improvements have been an iterative process where I used multiple different approaches to generate the geometry. In the Unity project I will showcase the most interesting ones. Amongst them are:
- Calculating cubes with a compute shader and merging the geometry on the CPU
- Calculating chunks with multiple interconnected cubes on a compute shader and merging chunks only on the CPU
- Calculating the Geometry entirely on the GPU and directly passing the result to the render shader

## Running the Code
Install Unity 2020.3.25f1 and open the project folder `unity` with unity.

Depending on your hardware there might be issues when running compute shaders that I cant anticipate. 
Preferably use a system with a dedicated external GPU.

## Inside the Unity Project
The unity project consists of multiple scenes showcasing different algorithms.
